Third Project: correctness proofs - 10 points
---------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to prove the correctness of a sorting
algorithm, which is given below, in SML. We will use a theorem verifier
called [Twelf](http://twelf.org/wiki/Main_Page).

    fun in_ord nil e = [e]
      | in_ord (h::t) e =
          if e < h then e::h::t
          else h :: in_ord t e
          
    fun sort nil = nil
      | sort (h::t) = in_ord (sort t) h

To show the correctness of this algorithm, we must first define it in
Twelf. Defining things in Twelf is not so straightforward: we must
define the notion of number, the idea of less-than and greater-than, the
concept of lists, the sorting algorithm, and what does it mean for a
list to be sorted. Fortunately, you will not have to provide all these
definitions, as they are available in the files below:

-   [arith.elf](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/assignment/src/arith.elf):
    this file defines numbers, and the notion of less-than-or-equal and
    greater-than.
-   [list.elf](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/assignment/src/list.elf):
    this file defines lists of numbers, the sorting algorithm, and the
    notion of a sorted list.
-   [arith.thm](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/assignment/src/arith.thm):
    this file proves a simple theorem, that you may find useful: if
    N1 \> N2, then N2 \<= N1.
-   [list.thm](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/assignment/src/list.thm):
    this file contains a skeleton of your formal proof. You must
    complete it, otherwise, once you try to run the Twelf server on it,
    you will get a `Coverage error`.
-   [sources.cfg](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/assignment/src/sources.cfg):
    this file is the twelf \"makefile\". To run it, you can start the
    twelf server, and then type: `make sort/sources.cfg`, assuming that
    all the files are in the directory `sort`.

**What must be turned in:** each group must e-mail the instructor only
the changed `list.thm` file, so that the entire proof passes the Twelf
verifier.
